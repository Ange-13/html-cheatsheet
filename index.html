    <!--HTML Colors-->
    <div>
      <h3>Some color theory:</h3>
      <p>
        HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with
        <b>RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA </b>values. You can use colors in many
        ways with the style inline attribute. However you can do the same but
        better when you learn CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML supports 140 standard color names. Some of them sound like this:
        tomato,chocolate,lightsalmon,darksalmon and other diferent foods.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not want to use the standard HTML colors, that's when the hard
        part comes in. So just use an exsisting HTML color. <br />
        Just kidding.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>RGB Color Values</h4>
      <p>
        In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
        <b>rgb(red, green, blue)</b> <br />
        Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color
        with a value between 0 and 255. <br />
        This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
        <br />For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is
        set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are
        set to 0.<br />
        You get the idea. However it is easier to just use a color picker and
        convert it to RGB or any other format you need. <br />
        There is also another version of this: <br />
        RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha
        channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. <br />
        An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) The
        alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not
        transparent at all).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>HEX Color Values</h4>
      <p>
        In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:
        <br />
        #rrggbb Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values
        between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255). <br />To display black, set
        all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000. <br />To display white,
        set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>HSL Color Values</h4>
      <p>
        HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. HSLA color values are an
        extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).<br />
        In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness
        (HSL) in the form: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>HSLA Color Values</h4>
      <p>
        HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha
        channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. <br />An HSLA color
        value is specified with: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
        <br />The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent)
        and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

        A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other
        HTML element! <br />
        You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the
        mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. The
        &lt; a &gt; element is an inline element. So you have to separate it.
